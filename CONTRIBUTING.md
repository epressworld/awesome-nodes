## Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Incubating Nodes

This list is the entry point for all new nodes. It's designed to be a fast-moving, fresh list of active participants in the `epress` network.

#### Inclusion Criteria
To be included, your node must meet these simple requirements:
- It must be accessible via a **unique domain name** (not a raw IP address).
- It must be served over **HTTPS**.
- It must be **online and accessible** at the time of submission.

#### Contribution Process
- Add your node to the **bottom** of the "Incubating Nodes" list in `README.md`. Adding to the bottom prevents merge conflicts and ensures a smooth process for everyone.

#### List Management
- The list has a maximum capacity of **50 nodes**.
- New nodes are added to the bottom of the list.
- When the list is full (at 50 nodes), the **oldest node (at the top of the list)** will be removed by the maintainer upon the merging of a new submission. This ensures a constant flow of new nodes.

### 2. Awesome Nodes

This is a curated list of established, high-quality nodes that have proven to be stable and valuable to the community.

#### Eligibility
- Any `epress` node can apply, whether it is currently in the "Incubating Nodes" list or not.

#### Inclusion Criteria
To be accepted into the "Awesome Nodes" list, a node must meet the following standards:

1.  **Uptime:** The node must have been continuously online for the **90 days** prior to the application.
2.  **Content Quality:** The node must have published at least **6 high-quality, long-form articles** within the last **90 days**. These should be meaningful posts with a clear topic and substantial content.
3.  **Social Proof:** The node must follow at least **1** other node and be followed by at least **1 "high-quality" follower**.
    - A "high-quality follower" is defined as a node that also follows at least one other node, proving it is an active participant and not just a shell account.

#### Application Process
1.  Submit a Pull Request that adds your node to the bottom of the "Awesome Nodes" list in `README.md`. (If your node is currently in the "Incubating" list, your PR should move it from one list to the other).
2.  The description of your Pull Request **must include proof** to help with verification:
    - **Links to the 6 long-form articles** that demonstrate your content quality.
    - The address of your **"high-quality follower"** for verification.
    - A link to a **public uptime status page**, if available.

#### Disclaimers
- The definition of "high-quality content" is subjective. **The final decision rests with the repository maintainer.**
- These standards may be adjusted over time as the community evolves.

### Formatting

Please use the following format for all submissions:

```markdown
- [Node Name](https-link-to-node) - A brief, one-sentence description of the node.
```

Thank you for making the `epress` network more awesome!
