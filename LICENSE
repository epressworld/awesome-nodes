Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further growth of science and knowledge, or to devote a
Work to the public domain.

To achieve these goals, an owner of a Work may use this document ("Document")
to make a clear statement of their intention to relinquish control of the
Work, permanently and irrevocably, by waiving, abandoning, and surrendering
all of their Copyright and Related Rights and neighboring rights as well as
all related claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including
existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i)
in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any
and all media and formats now known or hereafter devised, and (iv) for any
and all purposes including without limitation commercial purposes.

This Document is intended to create a public domain dedication to the extent
this is possible under applicable law. If a public domain dedication is not
possible, this Document is intended as a fallback license to enable anyone
to use the Work for any purpose without any conditions whatsoever unless
such conditions are required by law. If even that is not possible, this
Document is intended as a license granting the features of the public domain
dedication described above.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under this Document
may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright
and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in relation to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting databases in relation to a Work, subject to the
     limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 vi. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work; and
vii. other rights closely related to copyright or neighboring rights.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work:

  i. in all territories worldwide;
 ii. for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
     (including future time extensions);
iii. in any and all media and formats now known or hereafter devised; and
 iv. for any and all purposes including without limitation commercial
     purposes.

3. Public Domain Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted, and the Work
shall be offered to the public under the Public Domain Fallback License
set forth below.

The Work is provided to the public under a fallback license that is
equivalent to the public domain, enabling anyone to use the Work for any
purpose without any conditions whatsoever unless such conditions are
required by law.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
    or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or
    absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
    extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.

When the Work is used or cited, the user of the Work should not imply
any endorsement by the author or Affirmer.
